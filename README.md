# full-web-dev
An alternative guide to web development, aiming to get a rounded understanding
of the subject.
## Foreword
I am using this this to build a repository of knowledge for my own personal use
but also as a source to share with other developers. I am starting with 4 years
experience with computer science so although that means I know barely anything,
it also means that this might not be well tailored to an absolute beginner as I
lack the perspective for that.
## Beginner Resources
I didn't follow an onlice course to learn web development, I started off by
doing projects and studying around them, but I had already been a programmer
for two years before I started so I knew what to look for. I have added some 
resources here that other people recommend to get started on if you are starting from scratch.
### Free Code Camp (HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJs)
https://www.freecodecamp.org/
As far as I am aware, the defacto starting point for a lot of learners.
### Django Girls (HTML, CSS, Python, Django)
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/
I am not a Django Developer but this is a commonly recomended starting point if
you are interested in learning django from scratch.
## Full Stack
### Javascript
#### The state of JS
https://stateofjs.com/
A useful overview of Javascript trends over time and has particularly good
insight as to what frameworks are being used. This is useful for a beginner to
pick a popular starting point.

Reccomended by https://github.com/thimovss (yet to read myself)
## Linux
### Introduction
Linux is the most common operating system for web servers and also is a really
common development platform. While understanding Linux is not essential for web
developement, it is an interesting and rewarding thing to understand.

## History and Evolution
### RSS

it's original goal.
