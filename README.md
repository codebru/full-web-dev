## Foreword
I am using this this to build a repository of knowledge for my own personal use
but also as a source to share with other developers. I am starting with 4 years
experience with computer science so although that means I know barely anything,
it also means that this might not be well tailored to an absolute beginner as I
lack the perspective for that.
