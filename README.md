# full-web-dev
An alternative guide to web development, aiming to get a rounded understanding of the subject.
## Foreword
I am using this this to build a repository of knowledge for my own personal use but also as a source to share with other developers. I am starting with 4 years experience with computer science so although that means I know barely anything, it also means that this might not be well tailored to an absolute beginner as I lack the perspective for that.
