## Beginner Resources
I didn't follow an onlice course to learn web development, I started off by
doing projects and studying around them, but I had already been a programmer
for two years before I started so I knew what to look for. I have added some 
resources here that other people recommend to get started on if you are starting from scratch.
### Free Code Camp (HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJs)
https://www.freecodecamp.org/
As far as I am aware, the defacto starting point for a lot of learners.
### Django Girls (HTML, CSS, Python, Django)
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/
I am not a Django Developer but this is a commonly recomended starting point if
you are interested in learning django from scratch.
## Javascript
### The state of JS
https://stateofjs.com/
A useful overview of Javascript trends over time and has particularly good
insight as to what frameworks are being used. This is useful for a beginner to
pick a popular starting point.
## Modern Javascript Explained For Dinosaurs
